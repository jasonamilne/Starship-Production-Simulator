# Starship-Production-Simulator

Manufacturing Process Simulator

A configurable, discrete event simulator for modeling and analyzing complex production lines. This tool uses a JSON configuration file to define production stages, resources, and parameters, making it adaptable for various manufacturing scenarios, from aerospace to general assembly.

**Features**
- Configurable via JSON: Easily define your entire production line—including stages, processing times, quality control pass rates, and the number of parallel workstations—without changing any Python code.
- Discrete Event Simulation: Accurately models a complex system where resources (workstations) are shared, and processes can run in parallel, providing realistic insights into system behavior and bottlenecks.
- Data-Driven Analysis: Generates a detailed CSV log of every event in the simulation, perfect for ingestion into data analysis tools, BI dashboards (like Plotly Dash or Tableau), or machine learning models.
- Bottleneck & Rework Modeling: Simulates real-world challenges like QC failures and rework loops, allowing for a more accurate analysis of a production line's true capacity.

**How to Use**

**1. Configure the Simulation**

Modify the ```config.json``` file to define your production line. You can change the number of items to produce, adjust the parameters for each stage, and set the number of parallel workstations available.

**Example** ```config.json:```

```python
{
  "simulation_parameters": {
    "num_starships": 50,
    "start_date": "2025-01-01"
  },
  "production_stages": {
    "Ring_Stacking": {
      "mean_time_hours": 40,
      "std_dev_hours": 5,
      "pass_rate": 0.98,
      "station_count": 2
    },
    "Welding": {
      "mean_time_hours": 120,
      "std_dev_hours": 15,
      "pass_rate": 0.95,
      "station_count": 3
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Install Dependencies**

This script requires ```pandas``` and ```numpy```. You can install them using pip:

```python
pip install pandas numpy
```

**3. Run the Simulator**

Execute the data generator script from your terminal. It will read your config.json and create a detailed CSV log of the simulation.python 

```python
configurable_data_generator.py
```
  
This will produce a ```starship_production_log_configurable.csv``` file in the same directory, which is now ready for analysis.

**Next Steps**

The data generated by this simulator is designed to be the foundation for a business intelligence dashboard. The next step is to use a tool like **Plotly Dash** to create visualizations that analyze:

- Overall production throughput
- Cycle time per stage to identify bottlenecks
